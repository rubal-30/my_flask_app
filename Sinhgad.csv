The stunning views of mountains and valleys instill a sense of awe, complemented by the strong pride vibes surrounding the site.

The fort houses the samadhi of Tanaji Malusare and a Mahadev Temple at its summit, contributing to the spiritual ambiance.

Accessible by both driving and trekking, the journey to the fort offers flexibility.

However, be prepared for weekend crowds, as the fort attracts a significant influx of visitors.

For those who haven't experienced it yet, a trip to this fort is a must to appreciate the historical significance it holds. It's a great opportunity for kids to learn about our brave ancestors and the rich history of our country.

However, the disappointment sets in when you realize that the fort is in ruins and the renovation work is subpar. While some efforts have been made, the progress is slow and not up to standard. Additionally, the entrance fee seems unjustified given the lack of substantial renovation and basic facilities like housekeeping and washrooms.

Another letdown is the presence of locals trying to lure tourists to eat at their hotels inside the fort premises. This distracts from the overall experience of sightseeing and takes away from the historical significance of the fort.

In conclusion, while Sinhagad Fort holds immense historical value, the current state of management and facilities leaves much to be desired. Hopefully, improvements will be made in the future to preserve and enhance this important cultural heritage site.","","+3","","","Visited on","Weekend","Wait time","No wait","Reservation recommended","No","Like"

We started early from Chinchwad at 5:05 am to catch the sunrise. It was a smooth 50 minutes car ride and we reached 5 minutes before the gates were opened. A short ride took us up to the fort parking. The parking lot itself is a good sunrise view point.  A few flights of stairs and another short walk took us to the top of the fort.

There is little up there except an old water tank which still holds clear drinking water  and a memorial of Tanaji Malusare the famous Maratha warrior who won the fort for Shivaji but lost his life.

The views are worth the effort and time. Ranges after ranges of sprawling Sahyadri can be seen all around. In the distance is Rajgarh fort.

You can enjoy poha, kanda bhajiye, curd, lemon water, curd and much more from a number of food shacks.

I only wish the government could pay more attention to cleanliness and organised development of such a treasured heritage.
Pratapgarh fort near Mahabaleshwar is a case in point how such places can be developed and maintained.

To sum up - a must visit place for :
